# AdBlkr-Barebones
A lightweight Google Chrome extension designed to provide maximum blocking power in the smallest and least intrusive package.

Use Chrome Developer Mode to install this extension. Select "Load Unpackaged" in the top left of the extensions manager page
and navigate to the "AdBlkr Barebones" folder then hit select or okay.

We wanted to provide the ad blocker community with an extremely stripped down ad blocker that is effecive and has zero bloat.
Feel free to browse the files and modify them as you see fit. Happy coding!
